This is my `#good-enough` website. Done, but not finished.

`docs/` directory has the build output, just like GitHub Pages prefers it.

## Development

**Install dependencies**
```sh
npm install
```

**Watch files for changes and start local server**
```sh
npm run watch
```

**Open in browser**
```sh
open http://localhost:3000
```

**Build for production**
```sh
npm run build-prod
```
